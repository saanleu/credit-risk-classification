# credit-risk-classification
## Background
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.
## Instructions
The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:
#### Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
A value of 0 in the “loan_status” column means that the loan is healthy. A value of 1 means that the loan has a high risk of defaulting.
#### Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
Answer the following question: How well does the logistic regression model predict both the 0 (healthy loan) and 1 (high-risk loan) labels?
#### Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report
Write a brief report that includes a summary and analysis of the performance of the machine learning models that you used in this homework. 

# Credit Risk Analysis Report
## Overview - explains the purpose of this analysis. 

## use bulleted list, describe the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model.

## summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you don’t recommend the model, justify your reasoning.
